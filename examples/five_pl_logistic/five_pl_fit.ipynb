    "A five-parameter logistic (5PL) regression model is often preferred over a simpler four-parameter logistic (4PL) model for fitting biological data because it introduces an additional asymmetry parameter. Biological assays, such as dose-response curves or immunoassays, frequently exhibit slight asymmetrical behavior that the 4PL’s symmetric sigmoid curve cannot capture. By allowing for this extra degree of freedom, the 5PL model can more accurately describe the real-world shape of the response, leading to better fits and more reliable parameter estimates.\n",

Let's imagine we have 20 samples with a known concentration (standards) of an analyte.
